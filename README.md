Music Objects
===

This is experimental, mostly my attempt at creating musical objects and seeing what I can do with them.

A Pitch consists of a letter name and an octave number
An Interval/MidiInterval takes in 2 Pitches.
MidiCalc takes in 1 Pitch.
A Scale takes 1 Pitch and mode, can produce all modal scales in pitch class form. The letter name scale is still buggy.
